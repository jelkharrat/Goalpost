//Core Data Stack

//Core Data is for persistent storage. Allows you to save data regardless of closing an app

//Managed Object Model - pull data model into core data stack

//Managed Object Context - What does all the work. Interact with this most of the time. Keeps a reference to persistent store coordinator

//Persistent Store Coordinator -  Coordinates persistent data in the app. Holds the persistent store that hold all the info that we save. It understands the data model

//To create a core stat stack
//1) Instantiate data model which is used to create the managed object model which is required to create the persistent store coordinator

//2)Then persistent store coordinator is created so it can understand the managed object model

//3) Persistent Store Coordinator creates the persistent store once compatible
